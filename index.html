  <h1>Synth sETH</h1>
  <p>
    Synth sETH is an experimental blockchain asset created solely for academic and research purposes in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments.
    It is not intended for public investment or financial speculation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The token is designed to simulate synthetic Ether behavior for interoperability testing, liquidity experiments, and cross-chain analytics
    within controlled, non-production scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project aims to study decentralized finance mechanisms without any financial risk or obligation.
